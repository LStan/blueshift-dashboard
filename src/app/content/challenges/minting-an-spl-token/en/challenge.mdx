# Minting an SPL Token

The SPL token program, and specifically minting some tokens using Tyepscript, should be the first starting point in your journey as a Solana developer.

If you don't know anything about the SPL-Token program, follow [this course](en/courses/spl-token-with-web3js) before!

In this challenge, we're going to implement three simple instructions:
- **Create a Mint**: Create and initialize a `Mint` account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
- **Create an Associated Token Account**: Create and initialize an `Associated Token` account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
- **Mint 100 Tokens**: Mint 100 of the newly created tokens to the newly created `Associated Token` account

**Note**: If you're not familiar with how to use the SPL-Token program with typescript, you should start by reading the [SPL-Token with Web3Js](/en/courses/spl-token-with-web3js) to familiarize with the SDKs that we're going to need in this challenge.
