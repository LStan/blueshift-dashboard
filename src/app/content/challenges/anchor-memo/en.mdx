# Anchor Memo Program

Welcome to your first challenge using the Anchor framework on Solana! Your goal is to **create a simple memo program that logs a message** to the blockchain. This is a great introduction to how instructions work in Anchor.

The program only has one instruction and takes in:

- A `String` input
- No accounts

Then simply logs this string out using the Anchor `msg!()` macro.

Your program should also have a program Id of `22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222` to pass the challenge.
