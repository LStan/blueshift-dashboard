<ArticleSection name="What is a Soulbound Token?" id="what-is-a-soulbound-token" />

In the [Mint an SPL Token](/en/challenges/typescript-mint-an-spl-token) challenge, you tried your hands on creating
your very own token using the Token Program. SPL Tokens are fungible tokens, meaning all tokens are identical in value;
your tokens are as good and valuable as anyone else's tokens. This makes SPL Token a great choice for creating
cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or any other type of token that is meant to be exchanged or traded.

But not everything of value is fungible. In the real world, we have things that are valuable and unique to us, such
as our in-game achievements, certificates, and licenses. These items are not interchangeable with others, and are
not meant to be transferred or traded. To represent these unique and non-transferable assets on the blockchain, we
create Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).

To make an SBT on Solana, we are going to need the Token-2022 program with the Non-transferable extension.

Let's practice building a Soulbound Token (SBT) using the Token-2022 program with the Non-transferable extension.
If you need a refresher on Token-2022 or the Non-transferable extension, check out our
[Token2022 with Web3.js course](/en/courses/token-2022-with-anchor/non-transferable-extension) course.

In this challenge, we're going to implement eight simple instructions:

- Create a Mint: Creates a Mint Account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
- Create a mint close authority: Sets the authority to close the mint account to the wallet that is running the code.
- Create a Group: Creates a collection for the NFTs.


- Initialize Mint: Initialize the Mint Account created using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that
the SDK has. The mint should have 6 decimals, with mint and freeze authority set to the wallet that is running the
code.
-


Create a mint close authority using the raw instruction or the
abstracted
instruction that the SDK has.


    Create an Associated Token Account: Create and initialize an Associated Token Account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
    Mint 21 million Tokens: Mint 21 million (21,000,000) of the newly created tokens to the newly created Associated Token Account.
