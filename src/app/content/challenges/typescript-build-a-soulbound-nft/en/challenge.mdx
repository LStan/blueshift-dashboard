# Soulbound Token

In the [Mint an SPL Token](/en/challenges/typescript-mint-an-spl-token) challenge, you tried your hands on creating
your very own token using the Token Program. SPL Tokens are fungible tokens, meaning all tokens are identical in value;
your tokens are as good and valuable as anyone else's tokens. This makes SPL Token a great choice for creating
cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or any other type of token that is meant to be exchanged or traded.

But not everything of value is fungible. In the real world, we have things that are valuable and unique to us, such
as our certificates, diplomas, and licenses. These items are not interchangeable with others, and are not meant to be
transferred or traded. To represent these unique and non-transferable assets on the blockchain, we create Soulbound
Tokens (SBTs).

In this challenge, you will be building a soulbound NFT using [Token Extensions](https://solana.
com/solutions/token-extensions). Token Extensions, also known by its older name Token 2022, is the latest addition
to the Token Program family that extends the capability of the

they
can be exchanged or traded
with one another. For example, one SPL Token is equivalent to another SPL Token of the same type, just like how one
US dollar is equivalent to another US dollar.

However, not all tokens are fungible. Some tokens are non-fungible, meaning they are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. A good example of this is a non-fungible token (NFT), which represents a unique digital asset such as art, music, or collectibles.

In the real world, we often have items that are unique to us and cannot be transferred to someone else. For example, your birth certificate, diploma, or achievements are all unique to you and cannot be transferred to another person.

What do certificates, diplomas, and achievements have in common? They are all tied to an individual and cannot be
transferred to someone else.




In the world of blockchain, this concept is represented by Soulbound Tokens (SBTs).



In this challenge, we will extend what you've learned to create a non-transferable token, also known as a Soulbound
Token (SBT).

Soulbound tokens are often used to represent achievements, credentials, or other personal attributes that should not be transferred or traded.



learned
how to
create and mint a
fungible token on the Solana blockchain using the SPL Token program. In this challenge, we will extend that
knowledge to create a non-transferable token, also known as a Soulbound Token (SBT).

They are often used to represent achievements, credentials, or other personal attributes that should not be transferred or traded.




The SPL token program, and specifically minting some tokens using TypeScript, should be the first starting point in your journey as a Solana developer.

If you are new to the SPL Token program, follow this course before!

In this challenge, we're going to implement four simple instructions:

    Create a Mint: Create a Mint Account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
    Initialize Mint: Initialize the Mint Account created using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has. The mint should have 6 decimals, with mint authority set to the wallet that is running the code, and no freeze authority.
    Create an Associated Token Account: Create and initialize an Associated Token Account using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
    Mint 21 million Tokens: Mint 21 million (21,000,000) of the newly created tokens to the newly created Associated Token Account.

Note: If you're not familiar with how to use the SPL-Token program with TypeScript, you should start by reading the SPL Token with Web3.js to familiarize with the SDKs that we're going to need in this challenge.
