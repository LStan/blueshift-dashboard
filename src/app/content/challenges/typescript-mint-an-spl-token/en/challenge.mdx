# Mint an SPL Token

The SPL token program, and specifically minting some tokens using TypeScript, should be the first starting point in your journey as a Solana developer.

If you are new to the SPL Token program, follow [this course](/en/courses/spl-token-with-web3js) before!

In this challenge, we're going to implement four simple instructions:

- **Create a Mint**: Create a `Mint Account` using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
- **Initialize Mint**: Initialize the `Mint Account` created using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has. *The mint should have 6 decimals, with mint authority set to the wallet that is running the code, and no freeze authority*.
- **Create an Associated Token Account**: Create and initialize an `Associated Token Account` using the raw instruction or the abstracted instruction that the SDK has.
- **Mint 21 million Tokens**: Mint 21 million (21,000,000) of the newly created tokens to the newly created `Associated Token Account`.

**Note**: If you're not familiar with how to use the SPL-Token program with TypeScript, you should start by reading the [SPL Token with Web3.js](/en/courses/spl-token-with-web3js) to familiarize with the SDKs that we're going to need in this challenge.
