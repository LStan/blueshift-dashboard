# Pinocchio Memo Program

Welcome to your first challenge using Pinocchio! Your goal is to create a simple memo program that logs a message to the blockchain. This is a great introduction to how instructions work in Pinocchio.

The program only has one instruction and no accounts. It directly uses the `instruction_data` as the source of the string, then simply logs this string out using the `sol_log` syscall.

Your program should also have a program Id of `22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222` to pass the challenge.
