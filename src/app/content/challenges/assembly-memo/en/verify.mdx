<ChallengeTitle>sBPF Assembly Memo</ChallengeTitle>

Create a program only has one instruction. It must:
- Should fail if the instruction data contains any accounts (this can be done by setting `r0` to the number of accounts)
- Set `r2` to the length of the instruction data, and `r1` to the offset of the instruction data, 
- Invoke the `sol_log_` syscall.

Start by installing the sBPF package like explained in the [tooling section](/en/courses/introduction-to-assembly/tooling) of the Introduction to Assembly course and build your program using the following command in your terminal:

```
sbpf build
```

This will generate a `.so` file in your `target/deploy` folder. 

Now click on the `take challenge` button and drop the file there!
