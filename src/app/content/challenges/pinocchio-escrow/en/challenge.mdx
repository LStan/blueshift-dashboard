# The Escrow

An escrow is a powerful financial tool that enables secure token swaps between two parties.

Think of it as a digital safe deposit box where one user can lock up Token A, waiting for another user to deposit Token B before the swap is completed.

This creates a trustless environment where neither party needs to worry about the other backing out of the deal.

In this challenge, we're going to implement this concept through three simple but powerful instructions:
- **Make**: The maker (first user) defines the trade terms and deposits the agreed amount of Token A into a secure vault. This is like putting your item in the safe deposit box and setting the terms of the exchange.
- **Take**: The taker (second user) accepts the offer by transferring the promised amount of Token B to the maker, and in return, receives the locked Token A. This is the moment when both parties complete their side of the deal.
- **Refund**: If the maker changes their mind or no suitable taker is found, they can cancel the offer and retrieve their Token A. This is like getting your item back from the safe deposit box if the deal falls through.

**Note**: If you're not familiar with Pinocchio, you should start by reading the [Introduction to Pinocchio](learn.blueshift.gg/en/courses/introduction-to-pinocchio) to familiarize with the core concepts that we're going to use in this program.

Let's start by creating a fresh Rust environment:

```
# create workspace
cargo new blueshift_vault --lib --edition 2021
cd blueshift_vault
```

Add pinocchio, pinocchio-system, pinocchio-token and pinocchio-associated-token:

```
cargo add pinocchio pinocchio-system pinocchio-token pinocchio-associated-token-account
```

Declare the crate types in `Cargo.toml` to generate deployment artifacts in `target/deploy`:

```
[lib]
crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]
```

You're now ready to write your escrow program.

This time we'll split the program into small, focused modules instead of cramming everything into the `lib.rs`. The folder tree will look roughly like this:

```
src
├── instructions
│       ├── make.rs
│       ├── helpers.rs
│       ├── mod.rs
│       ├── refund.rs
│       └── take.rs
├── errors.rs
├── lib.rs
└── state.rs
```

The entrypoint, that lives in the `lib.rs` looks very similar to what we did in the last lessons so we're going to go over it very quickly:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
use pinocchio::{account_info::AccountInfo, entrypoint, program_error::ProgramError, pubkey::Pubkey, ProgramResult};
entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub mod instructions;
pub use instructions::*;

pub mod state;
pub use state::*;

// 22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222
pub const ID: Pubkey = [
    0x0f, 0x1e, 0x6b, 0x14, 0x21, 0xc0, 0x4a, 0x07,
    0x04, 0x31, 0x26, 0x5c, 0x19, 0xc5, 0xbb, 0xee,
    0x19, 0x92, 0xba, 0xe8, 0xaf, 0xd1, 0xcd, 0x07,
    0x8e, 0xf8, 0xaf, 0x70, 0x47, 0xdc, 0x11, 0xf7,
];

fn process_instruction(
    _program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    match instruction_data.split_first() {
        Some((Make::DISCRIMINATOR, data)) => Make::try_from((data, accounts))?.process(),
        Some((Take::DISCRIMINATOR, _)) => Take::try_from(accounts)?.process(),
        Some((Refund::DISCRIMINATOR, _)) => Refund::try_from(accounts)?.process(),
        _ => Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

<ArticleSection name="State" id="state" level="h2" />

We're going to move into the `state.rs` where all the data for our `Escrow` lives. Let's break this down into two parts: the struct definition and its implementation.

First, let's look at the struct definition:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
use pinocchio::{account_info::{AccountInfo, Ref}, program_error::ProgramError, pubkey::Pubkey};
use core::mem::size_of;

#[repr(C)]
pub struct Escrow {
    pub seed: u64,        // Random seed for PDA derivation
    pub maker: Pubkey,    // Creator of the escrow
    pub mint_a: Pubkey,   // Token being deposited
    pub mint_b: Pubkey,   // Token being requested
    pub receive: u64,     // Amount of token B wanted
    pub bump: [u8;1]      // PDA bump seed
}
```
</Codeblock>

The `#[repr(C)]` attribute ensures our struct has a predictable memory layout, which is crucial for on-chain data. Each field serves a specific purpose:
- **seed**: A random number that allows one maker to create multiple escrows with the same token pair
- **maker**: The wallet address that created the escrow and will receive the tokens
- **mint_a**: The SPL token mint address for the token being deposited
- **mint_b**: The SPL token mint address for the token being requested
- **receive**: The exact amount of token B that the maker wants to receive
- **bump**: A single byte used in PDA derivation to ensure the address is on the ed25519 curve

Now, let's look at the implementation with all its helper methods:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
impl Escrow {
    /// The length of the `Escrow` account data.
    /// This is calculated by summing the size of each field:
    /// - seed: 8 bytes (u64)
    /// - maker: 32 bytes (Pubkey)
    /// - mint_a: 32 bytes (Pubkey)
    /// - mint_b: 32 bytes (Pubkey)
    /// - receive: 8 bytes (u64)
    /// - bump: 1 byte ([u8;1])
    pub const LEN: usize = size_of::<u64>()
        + size_of::<Pubkey>()
        + size_of::<Pubkey>()
        + size_of::<Pubkey>()
        + size_of::<u64>()
        + size_of::<[u8;1]>();

    /// Safely loads an Escrow from an AccountInfo.
    /// Performs validation checks:
    /// 1. Verifies the account data length matches our struct
    /// 2. Confirms the account is owned by our program
    /// 3. Safely borrows the data
    #[inline]
    pub fn from_account_info(account_info: &AccountInfo) -> Result<Ref<Escrow>, ProgramError> {
        if account_info.data_len() != Self::LEN {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
        }
        if account_info.owner() != &crate::ID {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountOwner);
        }
        Ok(Ref::map(account_info.try_borrow_data()?, |data| unsafe {
            Self::from_bytes(data)
        }))
    }

    /// Unsafe version of from_account_info.
    /// Use this when you're certain there are no mutable borrows of the account data.
    /// Still performs length and owner validation.
    #[inline]
    pub unsafe fn from_account_info_unchecked(
        account_info: &AccountInfo,
    ) -> Result<&Self, ProgramError> {
        if account_info.data_len() != Self::LEN {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
        }
        if account_info.owner() != &crate::ID {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountOwner);
        }
        Ok(Self::from_bytes(account_info.borrow_data_unchecked()))
    }

    /// Converts raw bytes into an Escrow reference.
    /// This is unsafe because it assumes the bytes are properly formatted.
    #[inline(always)]
    pub unsafe fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> &Self {
        &*(bytes.as_ptr() as *const Escrow)
    }

    /// Sets all fields of the Escrow at once.
    /// This is more efficient than setting fields individually.
    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn set_inner(&mut self, seed: u64, maker: Pubkey, mint_a: Pubkey, mint_b: Pubkey, receive: u64, bump: [u8;1]) {
        self.seed = seed;
        self.maker = maker;
        self.mint_a = mint_a;
        self.mint_b = mint_b;
        self.receive = receive;
        self.bump = bump;
    }

    // Getters for all fields
    // These are marked #[inline(always)] for maximum performance
    // since they're called frequently in our program

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn seed(&self) -> &u64 {
        &self.seed
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn maker(&self) -> &Pubkey {
        &self.maker
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn mint_a(&self) -> &Pubkey {
        &self.mint_a
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn mint_b(&self) -> &Pubkey {
        &self.mint_b
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn receive(&self) -> &u64 {
        &self.receive
    }

    #[inline(always)]
    pub fn bump(&self) -> &[u8;1] {
        &self.bump
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

The implementation provides several key features:
1. **Exact Size Calculation**: `LEN` precisely calculates the account size by summing each field's size
2. **Safe Loading**: `from_account_info` provides a safe way to load and validate escrow data
3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - `#[inline(always)]` on getters for maximum performance
   - Unsafe methods for when we know the borrow is safe
   - Efficient field setting with `set_inner`
4. **Memory Safety**: Proper validation of account data length and ownership
5. **Documentation**: Clear comments explaining the purpose and safety considerations of each method

This implementation ensures our escrow state is both safe and efficient, with proper validation and performance optimizations where appropriate.
