<ArticleSection name="What is a Stablecoin?" id="what-is-a-stablecoin" />

Stablecoins have fueled the growth of the crypto ecosystem by removing the volatility risk of cryptocurrencies, enabling
companies and individuals to bring everyday businesses on-chain. Whether it's paying employees, covering expenses,
or raising funds, stablecoins unlock the potential of blockchains to serve as the backbone of a global financial
system.

While different mechanisms such as algorithmic stabilization have been explored to provide price stability, the
predominant approach is to peg their value to a less volatile asset, such as a fiat currency like the US dollar.
Because a fiat currency is involved, stablecoins have regulatory and compliance features not typically found in
other cryptocurrencies. This is where the Token-2022 program comes into play.

One of the primary use cases for Token-2022 and its many extensions is to support the regulatory and compliance
requirements of stablecoins, making Solana a great platform for building stablecoins.

In this challenge, we will build a stablecoin using the Token-2022 program. If you are new to Token-2022, our
[Token2022 with Web3.js](/en/courses/token-2022-with-web3js/introduction) course is a fast-paced introduction
to get you started quickly.

For the stablecoin we are building, we will implement eight instructions in a single transaction to:
- Create a Mint: Creates a Mint Account to represent our stablecoin
- Create a Mint Close Authority: Sets the authority with rights to close the mint account
- Set a Permanent Delegate: Appoint a delegate with administrative rights over the mint
- Set Transfer Fee: Charge a transfer fee on token transfers
- Set Transfer Hook: Set a transfer hook to execute custom logic on token transfers
- Set Token Metadata Pointer: Set the metadata address holding the token's information
- Initialize Mint: Initialize the Mint Account with 6 decimals, setting the mint and freeze authority
- Initialize the Metadata: Initializes the metadata for the mint, including the name, symbol, and URI

Let's dive in!
