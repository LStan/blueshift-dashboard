# The Cpi Guard Extension

The `CpiGuard` extension is a `Token` account extension that prohibits certain actions inside cross-program invocations, protecting users from malicious programs that might attempt to manipulate their token accounts without explicit consent.

> Unfortunately it's not possible to initialize or update the CpiGuard extension through a CPI, for more information read [this](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/6968859e2ee0a1764da572de340cdb58e2b4586f/token/program-2022/src/extension/cpi_guard/processor.rs#L44-L46)
