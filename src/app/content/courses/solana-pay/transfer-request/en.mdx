# Transfer Requests

The transfer request is Solana Pay's most straightforward payment method, designed for simple SOL or SPL token transfers without requiring any server interaction. 

When a user scans a QR code or clicks a transfer request link, their wallet has everything needed to compose and execute the transaction immediately.

Transfer request URLs follow a simple, standardized format that any Solana wallet can interpret:

```
solana:<recipient>?<optional-query-params>
```

The `recipient` is the only required parameter and must be a `base58-encoded` public key representing the destination wallet. This direct approach eliminates the need for payment processors or intermediaries: the payment goes straight from customer to merchant.

While only the recipient address is required, several optional parameters enhance the payment experience and provide crucial business functionality:
- `amount`: Specifies the exact transfer amount as a decimal value. Without this parameter, wallets typically prompt users to enter an amount manually, which works well for donations or flexible payment scenarios.
- `spl-token`: When transferring tokens other than SOL, include the mint address of the specific SPL token. This parameter transforms a SOL transfer into any token transfer, from USDC payments to custom loyalty tokens.
- `reference`: Provides a unique identifier that helps businesses track payments on-chain. Since merchants don't control the transaction signature, reference values serve as searchable identifiers for payment reconciliation and customer support.
- `label` and `message`: These user-facing strings explain the payment context. The label typically identifies the merchant or service, while the message describes the specific purchase or transaction purpose.
- `memo`: Creates an on-chain record within the transaction itself using Solana's memo program. This is particularly valuable for compliance, accounting, or providing permanent transaction context.

### Example 

Here's a transfer request for 1 SOL that demonstrates practical parameter usage:

```
solana:22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222?amount=1&label=Blueshift%20Subscription&message=1%20Month&memo=Order12345&reference=abc123def456
```

For businesses accepting stablecoins, here's a USDC transfer request:

```
solana:22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222?amount=200&spl-token=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&label=Blueshift%20Subscription&message=1%20Month&memo=Order12345&reference=abc123def456
```

Transfer requests excel in scenarios where payment details are predetermined and unchanging. E-commerce checkout flows, donation campaigns, subscription payments, and point-of-sale systems all benefit from transfer requests' simplicity and immediate execution.

The key advantage lies in their non-interactive nature.: once generated, these URLs work independently of your servers. This makes them perfect for situations where network connectivity might be unreliable or when you want to minimize infrastructure dependencies.

Consider using transfer requests when you need guaranteed payment amounts, want to reduce server load, or require payments to work even if your backend systems are temporarily unavailable. An example of this is the possibility of generating this type of transaction locally on the POS that is used to accept payments.
