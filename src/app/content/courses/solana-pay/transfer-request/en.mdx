# Transfer Requests

Transfer requests are Solana Pay's most straightforward payment method, designed for simple SOL or SPL token transfers without requiring any server interaction. When a user scans a QR code or clicks a transfer request link, their wallet has everything needed to compose and execute the transaction immediately.

The beauty of transfer requests lies in their simplicity: all payment information is encoded directly in the URL, making them completely self-contained and instantly executable.

Transfer request URLs follow a standardized format that any Solana wallet can interpret:

```
solana:<recipient>?<optional-query-params>
```

**Required Parameter:**
- `recipient`: A base58-encoded public key representing the destination wallet. This is the only mandatory field, ensuring payments go directly from customer to merchant without intermediaries.

**Optional Parameters:**
- **`amount`**: Specifies the exact transfer amount as a decimal value. Without this, wallets prompt users to enter an amount manuallyâ€”perfect for donations or flexible payment scenarios.
- **`spl-token`**: The mint address for SPL token transfers. Transforms a SOL transfer into any token transfer, from USDC payments to custom loyalty tokens.
- **`reference`**: A unique identifier for tracking payments on-chain. Since merchants don't control transaction signatures, references serve as searchable identifiers for payment reconciliation and customer support.
- **`label` and `message`**: User-facing strings that explain payment context. Label typically identifies the merchant, while message describes the specific purchase.
- **`memo`**: Creates an on-chain record using Solana's memo program. Valuable for compliance, accounting, or providing permanent transaction context.

### Example 

Here's a transfer request for 1 SOL that demonstrates practical parameter usage:

```
solana:22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222?amount=1&label=Blueshift%20Subscription&message=1%20Month&memo=Order12345&reference=abc123def456
```

For businesses accepting stablecoins, here's a USDC transfer request:

```
solana:22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222?amount=200&spl-token=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&label=Blueshift%20Subscription&message=1%20Month&memo=Order12345&reference=abc123def456
```

Transfer requests excel in scenarios where payment details are predetermined and unchanging:

**Perfect Use Cases:**
- **E-commerce checkouts** with fixed pricing
- **Donation campaigns** where users choose amounts
- **Subscription payments** with known amounts
- **Point-of-sale systems** for in-person transactions
- **Invoice payments** with specific amounts

**Key Advantages:**
- **Non-Interactive Nature:** Once generated, these URLs work independently of your servers. Perfect for situations where network connectivity might be unreliable or when you want to minimize infrastructure dependencies.
- **Guaranteed Execution:** Payment parameters are locked in the URL, ensuring customers pay exactly what you expect without dynamic pricing changes.
- **Offline Capability:** URLs can be generated locally on devices like POS terminals, enabling payments even if backend systems are temporarily unavailable.
- **Reduced Server Load:** No API calls needed during payment processing, making them highly scalable for high-volume scenarios.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Any Solana wallet can process these requests without requiring wallet-specific integrations.

Consider transfer requests when you need guaranteed payment amounts, want to reduce server dependencies, or require a payment method that works reliably in all network conditions.
