# LiteSVM 101

![Testing with LiteSVM](/graphics/course-banners/testing-with-litesvm.png)

Solana program testing traditionally forces you to choose between speed and accuracy. LiteSVM eliminates this tradeoff by delivering an in-process testing environment that's both lightning-fast and feature-complete.

LiteSVM provides three critical advantages for Solana developers:
- **Faster execution** compared to `solana-program-test` and `solana-test-validator`
- **Direct account state manipulation** for testing complex edge cases
- **Built-in performance profiling** for identifying optimization and improvments

[LiteSVM](https://github.com/LiteSVM/litesvm) is a lightweight Solana Virtual Machine that runs directly in your test process. Created by [Aursen](https://x.com/exoaursen) from [Exotic Markets](https://x.com/exotic_markets_), it eliminates the overhead of external validators while maintaining full compatibility with Solana's runtime.

Unlike traditional testing approaches that spawn separate validator processes, LiteSVM embeds the VM within your tests. This architecture delivers dramatically faster compilation and execution times without sacrificing testing accuracy.

The library offers an intuitive API with smart defaults for quick setup, plus extensive configuration options for advanced testing scenarios. 

> LiteSVM supports Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Python (via `solders`).
