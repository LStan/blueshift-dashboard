Throughout this course, you've mastered essential Surfpool concepts:
- **Mainnet simulation**: How Surfpool fetches mainnet accounts just-in-time, eliminating complex setup for CPI testing
- **Advanced control**: Time traveling to any epoch/slot/timestamp, pausing block production, and manipulating system variables
- **Account modification**: Setting SOL supply parameters, transferring accounts between programs, and updating token account data
