# The Entrypoint 

The `entrypoint!()` is the single symbol every Solana program must expose. It is the hand-off point where the Solana runtime jumps from the loader into your code.

Before the jump, the loader packs everything an instruction needs into one flat, C-style record stored on the BPF VM's input page. The macro then unpacks that record and hands your Rust three safe slices and references:
- **program_id**: the pubkey of the program that is currently executing.
- **accounts**: a pointer to a contiguous array of AccountInfo records, plus a length.
- **instruction_data**: a pointer-plus-length slice of raw bytes supplied by the transaction.

The macro will:
- Converting those raw pointers into safe Rust slices.
- Catching panics so they become clean `ProgramError::Custom` codes instead of crashing the VM.
- Forwarding everything to a user-defined function (often called `process_instruction`) that returns a `ProgramResult`.

Here's a description of the single, flat record that the Solana loader places in the BPF VM's input page before jumping to your entrypoint.

```rust
pub struct Entrypoint {
    account_len: u64,
    account_info: [AccountRaw; account_len]
    instruction_len: u64,
    instruction_data: [u8; instruction_len]
    program_id: [u8; 32],
}
```
- `account_len`: number of accounts sent in.
- `account_info`: the raw account records in the instruction, one after another.
- `instruction_len`: how many bytes of instruction data follow.
- `instruction_data`: the instruction itself
- `program_id`: the 32-byte `Pubkey` of the program being run.

Every element of the `account_info` array then follows the same packed layout:

```rust
pub struct AccountRaw {
    is_duplicate: u8,
    is_signer: u8,
    is_writable: u8,
    executable: u8,
    alignment: u32,
    key: [u8; 32],
    owner: [u8; 32],
    lamports: u64,
    data_len: usize,
    data: [u8; data_len],
    padding: [u8; 10_240],
    alignment_padding: [u8; ?],
    rent_epoch: i64,
}
```
- `is_duplicate`: make sure to not "redeserialize" the data if the same account appears more than once in the list by skipping it. `0xFF` means "unique"; any other value is the index it copies.
- `is_signer` / `is_writable` / `executable`: single-byte flags that the runtime uses so your program can gate logic and CPIs without extra syscalls.
- `alignment`: A placeholder four-byte slot that keeps the whole struct 8-byte aligned. Pinocchio repurposes it to track the original data length during reallocs.
- `key` / `owner` / `lamports`: The minimum viable data that each account should have.
- `data_len` + `data`: The variable-length data that the account might have.
- `padding`: The loader pre-allocates 10_240 bytes, the maximum size of an account, so the account data can change and grow in place without moving memory.
- `align_padding`: Extra filler, if required, so the next `AccountRaw` still starts on an 8-byte boundary (important for some eBPF hosts).
- `rent_epoch`:	Epoch when the account must next pay rent; kept for compatibility even though rent collection is paused.
