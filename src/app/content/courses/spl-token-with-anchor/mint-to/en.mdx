# Mint To Instruction

Creates new tokens and deposits them into a specified account. Only the mint authority can perform this operation.

Before we can mint any token, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account which we hold the `mintAuthority`
- Initialized a `Token` account or `Associated Token` account where we're going to mint tokens to

> The amount of tokens we mint are "normalized" for decimals. This means that if we want to mint 1 token that has 6 decimals, we'll need to actually put `1_000_000` as amount

This is how the CPI to the `mint_to()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
mint_to(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        MintTo {
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint_account.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.to_token_account.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
    &1_000_000,
)?;
```
