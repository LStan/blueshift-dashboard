# Instructions

As we saw earlier, using the `TryFrom` trait allows us to cleanly separate validation from business logic, improving both maintainability and security.

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Structure" id="instruction-structure" level="h2" />

When it's time to process the logic, we can create a structure like this: 

```rust
pub struct Deposit<'a> {
    pub accounts: DepositAccounts<'a>,
    pub instruction_datas: DepositInstructionData,
}
```

This structure defines what data will be accessible during the logic processing. We then deserialize this using the `try_from` function that you can find in the `lib.rs` file:

```rust
impl<'a> TryFrom<(&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])> for Deposit<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from((data, accounts): (&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let accounts = DepositAccounts::try_from(accounts)?;
        let instruction_datas = DepositInstructionData::try_from(data)?;

        Ok(Self {
            accounts,
            instruction_datas,
        })
    }
}
```

This wrapper provides three key benefits:
1. It accepts both raw inputs (bytes and accounts)
2. It delegates validation to the individual `TryFrom` implementations
3. It returns a fully-typed, fully-validated Deposit struct

We can then implement the processing logic like this:

```rust
impl<'a> Deposit<'a> {
    pub const DISCRIMINATOR: &'a u8 = &0;

    pub fn process(&self) -> ProgramResult {
        // deposit logic
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

- The `DISCRIMINATOR` is the byte we use for pattern matching in the entrypoint
- The `process()` method contains only business logic, as all validation checks are already complete

The result? We get Anchor-style ergonomics with all the benefits of being fully native: explicit, predictable, and fast.

<ArticleSection name="Cross Program Invocation" id="cross-program-invocation" level="h2" />

As mentioned earlier, Pinocchio provides helper crates like `pinocchio-system` and `pinocchio-token` that simplify Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) to native programs. 

These helper structs and methods replace Anchor's `CpiContext` approach we used previously:

```rust
Transfer {
    from: self.accounts.owner,
    to: self.accounts.vault,
    lamports: self.instruction_datas.amount,
}
.invoke()?;
```

The `Transfer` struct (from `pinocchio-system`) encapsulates all the fields required by the System Program, and `.invoke()` executes the CPI. No context builder or extra boilerplate needed.

When the caller must be a Program-Derived Address (PDA), Pinocchio maintains the same concise API:

```rust
let seeds = [
    Seed::from(b"vault"),
    Seed::from(self.accounts.owner.key().as_ref()),
    Seed::from(&[bump]),
];
let signers = [Signer::from(&seeds)];

Transfer {
    from: self.accounts.vault,
    to: self.accounts.owner,
    lamports: self.accounts.vault.lamports(),
}
.invoke_signed(&signers)?;
```

**Here's how it works:**
1. `Seeds` creates an array of Seed objects that match the PDA derivation
2. `Signer` wraps these seeds in a Signer helper
3. `invoke_signed` executes the CPI, passing the signer array to authorize the transfer

The result? A clean, first-class interface for both regular and signed CPIs - no macros required, and no hidden magic.
