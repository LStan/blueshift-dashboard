# Blockchain: the new Web

Most people encounter blockchain through `Bitcoin` or `NFTs`, but this narrow view misses the bigger picture. Blockchain isn't just about creating digital currencies; it's about fundamentally reimagining how the internet works. 

While financial applications grabbed headlines first, blockchain's real potential lies in solving problems that have plagued the web since its inception: centralized control, single points of failure, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants.

<ArticleSection name="The evolution of the Web" id="the-evolution-of-the-web" level="h2" />

From its inception, the "web" changed a lot:
- **Web 1.0** was the "read-only web": static HTML pages linked together. The web was decentralized by design, with anyone able to host their own server and publish content.
- **Web 2.0** introduced the "read-write web": platforms where users could create and share content. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter emerged as central hubs where billions of users congregate. However, this convenience came at a cost: a handful of companies now control vast portions of online activity.
- **Web 3.0** (or web3 for blockchain native people) aims to create a "read-write-own web": where users not only consume and create content but also own their data, digital assets, and participation in the networks they help build. This isn't about making the current web slightly better; it's about returning to the web's original decentralized vision while adding new capabilities

Blockchains purpose isn't to replace your bank account; it's to eliminate the need for hierarchical gatekeepers in digital interactions. 

In today's web, every meaningful action requires permission from a central authority: your bank approves transactions, Facebook decides if your post violates community standards, Apple determines which apps can exist on your phone.

Blockchain, alongside peer-to-peer networks and privacy technologies like I2P (Invisible Internet Project), forms the technological foundation for escaping these hierarchies. Together, these technologies enable direct peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries, censorship-resistant communication, and permissionless innovation.

### The biggest shift from web 2.0

The most profound shift Web3 brings is eliminating the traditional client-server model. Currently, you (the client) request data from powerful servers owned by companies. 

Web3 applications run on networks where every participant can create its own client to interact with the servers and at the same time can act as both client and server. When you use a blockchain-based application, you're not just consuming a service; you're participating in the network that provides that service.

> This architectural shift means no single point of failure, transparent operations, aligned incentives, and permissionless participation. 

To fundamentally alter this hierarchy, Blockchain requires storing information in multiple copies and distributing it via a peer-to-peer computer network. This set of technologies could thus move beyond the simple role of cryptocurrency databases to become the foundation for a new network.

We can consider Blockchain has global databases. In Web2, you have a MySQL database on your server. In Web3, that database is replicated across thousands of servers worldwide, and every write operation requires majority consensus making it extremely reliable and "safe" since no one can unilaterally push data to that database without the consensus of the other nodes.

Most Blockchains implement **Smart Contract**: a self-executing programs that run on blockchain networks. Think of them as digital vending machines; you put in the right input (money), and they automatically deliver the output (snack) without needing a human operator.

The same way Web2 developers write business logic in their backend code. Smart contracts are just business logic that runs on this global database. The difference? Once deployed, they run forever without you paying for servers, and they're guaranteed to execute exactly as written making them a "programmable" option to your logic.

With the advent of wallets, on blockchains authentication doesn't require passwords anymore. Instead of username/password or OAuth, users prove identity with cryptographic signatures. Think of your wallet like an SSH keys; they sign a message with their private key, you verify with their public key. No user database needed.

And one of the biggest features is that, since we're using a database that is permissionless and replicated across thousands of servers worldwide, APIs can't Be rate limited or shut down. Web3 protocols are like APIs that run on the blockchain; they're always available, can't be modified, and have predictable costs.

You might be familiar with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana as cryptocurrencies. The reality is that these tokens are not just speculative vehicles, but they represent the "gas" tokens that need to be held in order to use the underlying blockchain technology of these networks.

There are significant differences between each blockchain based on their different use cases, and before choosing what blockchain to build on, it's important to understand all the nuances:

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is built for simple, secure value transfer. Thanks to its long track record of 15+ years of continuous operation and its limited supply (there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence) it's considered the Digital Gold Standard.

It's extremely secure but slow, processing only 7 transactions per second, and doesn't allow building complex applications since it lacks native smart contract capabilities. 

Bitcoin operates on a Proof of Work consensus mechanism, which means it's highly secure because consensus is reached by solving complex algorithms that require significant computational power to mine new bitcoins.

Thanks for its long track record, 15+ years of continuous operation, and its limited supply, there will only be 21M Bitcoin in eternity, it's considered the Digital Gold Standard.

Its extremely secure but slow (7 transactions per second) and doesn't allow building "complex applications" since it doesn't really have native smart contracts capabilities. 

Its a Proof of Mining network, this means that it's very secure because consensus is reached by solving complex algorithm that requires a lot of hashpower in order to receive a rewards and "mine" bitcoins.

### Ethereum

Ethereum was the first blockchain with native smart contract capabilities, making it perfect for building general-purpose decentralized applications. 

It has billions in value locked in applications and it's defined as "The World Computer". Ethereum boasts one of the largest developer ecosystems with extensive tools, libraries, and documentation.

However, Ethereum uses Solidity as its programming language and is expensive and slow, processing only 15 transactions per second. This makes it heavily reliant on Layer 2 solutions and not the first choice for developers migrating from the Web2 world who expect fast, responsive applications and familiar programming langauges.

### Solana

Solana has native smart contract capabilities and is currently the most popular high-performance blockchain option. 

It's built for high-speed applications that need to feel like Web2 experiences; imagine having a fast, modern database with smart contract capabilities.

While Solana's ecosystem is still maturing, it's already extremely fast with capabilities of 65,000 transactions per second and maintains really low fees even during times of network congestion. 

It uses Rust as the main language for smart contracts, making it the perfect choice for developers switching from traditional programming environments.

> Solana will be the blockchain we focus on this course.
