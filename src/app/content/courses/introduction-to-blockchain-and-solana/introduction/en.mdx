# Blockchain: The New Web

Most people encounter blockchain through `Bitcoin` or `NFTs`, but this narrow view misses the bigger picture. Blockchain isn't just about creating digital currencies; it's about fundamentally reimagining how the internet works.

While financial applications grabbed headlines first, blockchain's real potential lies in solving problems that have plagued the web since its inception: centralized control, single points of failure, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants.

<ArticleSection name="The evolution of the Web" id="the-evolution-of-the-web" level="h2" />

From its inception, the web has evolved significantly:
- **Web 1.0** was the "read-only web": static HTML pages linked together. The web was decentralized by design, with anyone able to host their own server and publish content.
- **Web 2.0** introduced the "read-write web": platforms where users could create and share content. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter emerged as central hubs where billions of users gather. However, this convenience came at a cost: a handful of companies now control vast portions of online activity.
- **Web 3.0** (or web3 for those familiar with blockchain) aims to create a "read-write-own web": users not only consume and create content but also own their data, digital assets, and participation in the networks they help build. This isn't about making the current web slightly better; it's about returning to the web's original decentralized vision while adding new capabilities.

Blockchain's purpose isn't to replace your bank account; it's to eliminate the need for hierarchical gatekeepers in digital interactions.

In today's web, every meaningful action requires permission from a central authority: your bank approves transactions, Facebook decides if your post violates community standards, and Apple determines which apps can exist on your phone.

Blockchain, alongside peer-to-peer networks and privacy technologies like I2P (Invisible Internet Project), forms the technological foundation for escaping these hierarchies. Together, these technologies enable direct peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries, censorship-resistant communication, and permissionless innovation.

### The biggest shift from Web 2.0

The most profound shift Web3 brings is the elimination of the traditional client-server model. Currently, you (the client) request data from powerful servers owned by companies.

Web3 applications run on networks where every participant can create their own client to interact with the servers and, at the same time, act as both client and server. When you use a blockchain-based application, you're not just consuming a service; you're participating in the network that provides it.

> This architectural shift means no single point of failure, transparent operations, aligned incentives, and permissionless participation.

To fundamentally alter this hierarchy, blockchain requires storing information in multiple copies and distributing it via a peer-to-peer computer network. This set of technologies could thus move beyond the simple role of cryptocurrency databases to become the foundation for a new network.

We can consider blockchains as global databases. In Web2, you have a MySQL database on your server. In Web3, that database is replicated across thousands of servers worldwide, and every write operation requires majority consensus, making it extremely reliable and "safe" since no one can unilaterally push data to that database without the consensus of the other nodes.

Most blockchains implement **Smart Contracts**: self-executing programs that run on blockchain networks. Think of them as digital vending machines: you put in the right input (money), and they automatically deliver the output (a snack) without needing a human operator.

The same way Web2 developers write business logic in their backend code, smart contracts are just business logic that runs on this global database. The difference? Once deployed, they run forever without you paying for servers, and they're guaranteed to execute exactly as written, making them a "programmable" option for your logic.

With the advent of wallets, authentication on blockchains no longer requires passwords. Instead of a username/password or OAuth, users prove their identity with cryptographic signatures. Think of your wallet like SSH keys: it signs a message with its private key, and you verify it with the public key. No user database is needed.

And one of the biggest features is that, since we're using a database that is permissionless and replicated across thousands of servers worldwide, APIs can't be rate-limited or shut down. Web3 protocols are like APIs that run on the blockchain: they're always available, can't be modified, and have predictable costs.

<ArticleSection name="Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Solana" id="bitcoin-vs-ethereum-vs-solana" level="h2" />

You might be familiar with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as cryptocurrencies. The reality is that these tokens are not just speculative vehicles; they represent the "gas" tokens that must be held to use the underlying blockchain technology of these networks.

There are significant differences between each blockchain based on their different use cases, and before choosing which blockchain to build on, it's important to understand all the nuances:

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is built for simple, secure value transfer. Thanks to its long track record of over 15 years of continuous operation and its limited supply (there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence), it's considered the Digital Gold Standard.

It's extremely secure but slow, processing only 7 transactions per second, and doesn't allow for building complex applications since it lacks native smart contract capabilities.

Bitcoin operates on a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which means it's highly secure because consensus is reached by solving complex algorithms that require significant computational power to mine new bitcoins.

### Ethereum

Ethereum was the first blockchain with native smart contract capabilities, making it perfect for building general-purpose decentralized applications.

It has billions in value locked in applications and is defined as "The World Computer." Ethereum boasts one of the largest developer ecosystems with extensive tools, libraries, and documentation.

However, Ethereum uses Solidity as its programming language and is expensive and slow, processing only 15 transactions per second. This makes it heavily reliant on Layer 2 solutions and not the first choice for developers migrating from the Web2 world who expect fast, responsive applications and familiar programming languages.

### Solana

Solana has native smart contract capabilities and is currently the most popular high-performance blockchain option.

It's built for high-speed applications that need to feel like Web2 experiences; imagine having a fast, modern database with smart contract capabilities.

While Solana's ecosystem is still maturing, it's already extremely fast, with capabilities of 65,000 transactions per second, and maintains very low fees even during times of network congestion.

It uses Rust as the main language for smart contracts, making it the perfect choice for developers switching from traditional programming environments.

> Solana will be the blockchain we focus on in this course.
