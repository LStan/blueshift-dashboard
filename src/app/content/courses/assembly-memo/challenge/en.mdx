# sBPF Assembly Memo Program
Welcome to your first challenge using sBPF Assembly! Your goal is to create a simple memo program that logs a message to the blockchain. This is a great introduction to how instructions work in sBPF Assembly.

The program only has one instruction and no accounts. It sets the `r0` register to the number of accounts in the instruction data, `r2` to the length of the instruction data, and `r1` to the offset of the instruction data, then invokes the `sol_log_` syscall.

Your program should also have a program Id of `22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222` to pass the challenge.
